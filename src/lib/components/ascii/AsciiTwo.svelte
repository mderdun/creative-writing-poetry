    <div class="mt-16 text-justify">2. I feel like god has no more time for me because when I was in syria with my cousins and they were saying that their uncle doesn’t really pray properly and I told them its really important otherwise missing it on purpose is really wrong and a sin but I think it came from a place of arrogance what I said, with me feeling like I was better than them. And now since September I can’t pray either I snooze my alarm or I don’t even recall waking up to it in the first place</div>
